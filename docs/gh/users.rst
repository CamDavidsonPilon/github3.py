.. I'm not sure I like this or if i should use :mod:`users`

If you want to manage a user, use the `Users`_ module:

.. _Users: ../modules/users.html

but if you want a list of all users in order they signed up to GitHub, use:

.. similarly to above, perhaps :func:`iter_all_users` would be better suited inline?

.. autofunction:: github3.iter_all_users
